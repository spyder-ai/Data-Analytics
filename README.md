# Data-Analytics
Hi there, I am Prasanta and the files that has been uploaded here are created by me.
So, sit back and open up the file and get the insights.

#I have created three types of files
1. with the extension .ipynb(basically jupyter notebook)
2. with the extension .py(python code)
3. with the extension .pdf(the dashboard thing)

if you have jupyter notebook installed first run the ipynb file to get the exact view of my code and the data models
then head toward the pdf, i have separated the files with their following name so that you don't get confused what to select first

if you don't have jupyter notebook installed then open the .py file which ever you want then proceed with the same file name .pdf extension

# Soon I will be launching my portfolio website through which you can easily hover my contribuitions.

Thank you,
